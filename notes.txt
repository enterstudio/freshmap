Web Service:
  http://www.freshbooks.com/recent-events

Problem:
  XMLHttpRequest cannot make cross-domain requests without altering endpoint (not possible for hackoff).

Ideas:
  Write a quick python app that calls the web service every 5 seconds and dumps the data into an SQLite
  database. Create a local web service that reads and deletes records from the database. Call the local
  web service from the JS XHR.
